Social coding and open software - What can you do to get credit for your code and to allow reuse
================================================================================================

In this lesson we will discuss how and why to share code and data, what kind of
licenses are used in what situation, and how software can be cited.

We will try to connect software licenses to FAIR principles, give practical
recommendations for starting, contributing, and reusing code and help you
navigating and deciding on licenses.


.. admonition:: Why software licenses matter

   - You **find some great code** or data that you want to reuse for your own
     publication (good for the original author: you will cite them and maybe other
     people who cite you will cite them).

   - You need to **modify the code** a little bit, or you remix the data a bit.

   - When it comes time to publish, you realize there is no **license**.

   Now we have a problem:

   - You manage to **publish the paper without the software/data** but others cannot
     build on your software and data and
     you don't get as many citations as you could.
   - Or, you **cannot publish it at all** if the journal requires that papers should
     come with data and software so that they are reproducible.

   This lesson is about how to avoid this situation for you and others.
