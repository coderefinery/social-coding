Social coding
=============

In this lesson we will discuss how and why to share code, what kind of licenses
are used in what situation, and how software can be cited.

We will try to connect software licenses to FAIR principles, give practical
recommendations for starting, contributing, and reusing code and help you
navigating and deciding on licenses.
