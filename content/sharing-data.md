# Sharing data


## Services for sharing and collaborating on research data

To find a research data repository for your data, you can search on the
[Registry of Research Data Repositories (re3data)](https://www.re3data.org/)
platform and filter by country, content type, discipline, etc.

**International:**
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): A general-purpose open access repository
  created by OpenAIRE and CERN. Integration with GitHub, allows
  researchers to upload files up to 50 GB.
- [Figshare](https://figshare.com/): Online digital repository where researchers
  can preserve and share their research outputs (figures, datasets, images and videos).
  Users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable,
  shareable and discoverable manner.
- [EUDAT](https://eudat.eu): European platform for researchers and practitioners from any research discipline to preserve, find, access, and process data in a trusted environment.
- [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/): A general-purpose home for a wide diversity of datatypes,
  governed by a nonprofit membership organization.
  A curated resource that makes the data underlying scientific publications discoverable,
  freely reusable, and citable.
- [The Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/): Gives free accounts for collaboration
  around files and other research artifacts. Each account can have up to 5 GB of files
  without any problem, and it remains private until you make it public.
- [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/)

**Sweden:**
- [ICOS for climate data](http://www.icos-sweden.se/)
- [Bolin center climate / geodata](https://bolin.su.se/data/)
- [NBIS for life science, sequence –omics data](https://nbis.se/infrastructure)

**Norway:**
- [NIRD archive is widely used by some communities](https://archive.norstore.no/)
- [NSD - Norwegian Center for Research Data, for any kind of data](https://nsd.no/nsd/english/index.html)
- [Dataverse.no - Dataverse network, based at University of Tromsø but open for other institutions](https://dataverse.no/)

**Denmark:**
- [opendata.dk nationwide portal](http://www.opendata.dk)
- [Danish portal for sharing geographical data](http://brugstedet.dk/)

**Finland:**
- [IDA, for general data](https://ida.fairdata.fi/login)
- [FSD for social data](https://www.fsd.uta.fi/en/)

## Licensing of datasets and databases

- The EU has a [database directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_Directive) which restricts data mining on
  databases.
- Has a somewhat similar effect to copyright, because copyright would
  not apply to data mining.
- A good license also gives rights to data mine. So not a major concern.

When you can use datasets:
- The license allows
- Your country has exceptions for research
- The data doesn't come from the EU

License text, slides, images, and supporting information under a
[Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), and get a DOI using
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) or [Figshare](https://figshare.com) or [OSF](https://osf.io/) other services.

## Licensing and machine learning/ AI

**Is it data? Is it software?**
We need to consider the AI solution, the training data, the production data,
the AI output, and AI evolutions.


**How about ethics? How about liability?**
- [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
- Models can be reverse-engineered and training data can be extracted
- What if the model generates an outcome that is dangerous?
.cite[Thanks to E. Glerean for pointing these issues out to us]
