## Basics

This is basically presented as-is - not much technical presentation is
needed.

There are the following main acts:

- First section is about social coding and sharing code and motivation for
  sharing code with a discussion that licensing alone isn't enough. If you want
  people to use your work, you need to do more to make your work easily reusable.
  Use this as an entry point to tell people what is coming up in the rest of
  CodeRefinery (if this talk is on day 1 of a CodeRefinery workshop) or
  re-emphasize how past lessons all fit together (if on the last day).

- Emphasis of the concept of derivative work and that everything is
  based on other things. And if your goal is citations, you want as
  many people using your work as possible, because then they can cite
  you.

- A bit of details on free software and choosing a license. There are many
  online resources, and the biggest
  question is permissive vs. weak copyleft vs. strong copyleft. The cake analogy
  for licenses is only linked can be skipped and does not have to be discussed in detail.

- Finally a brief section on code citations. It's good if you manage to start a discussion
  around this topic.


## Hints

In the source code, in HTML comments, are various hints and stories
you can give. These can help to motivate reasons to license.

Before you begin, it's worth thinking about some particular good or
bad cases you know about from your experience.
- When have you lost access or not been able to use something because
  licensing wasn't handled well.
- When did multiple ownership mess up your plans?

This talk used to be called "software licensing".  You could mention
that to make it more interesting, we have adopted the current broader
name, and our emphasis is not just licensing, but why licensing is
needed.
