# Instructor guide

## Basics

This is basically presented as-is - not much technical presentation is
needed.

There are the following main acts:

- First section is about social coding and sharing code and motivation for
  sharing code with a discussion that licensing alone isn't enough. If you want
  people to use your work, you need to do more to make your work easily reusable.

- Emphasis of the concept of derivative work and that everything is
  based on other things. And if your goal is citations, you want as many
  people using your work as possible, because then they can cite you.

- Overview of license types. There are many
  online resources, and the biggest question is permissive vs. weak copyleft
  vs. strong copyleft.
  The [cake analogy for licenses](https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/social-coding/main/licensing-and-cakes.md/)
  is only linked and can be skipped and does not have to be discussed in
  detail.

- Then a brief section on code citations. It's good if you manage to start a discussion
  around this topic.

- The "Sharing data" part is meant to bring awareness about FAIRness and
  Open Science and to show how DOIs can be obtained for Git repositories.


## Hints

Before you begin, it's worth thinking about some particular good or
bad cases you know about from your experience.
- When have you lost access or not been able to use something because
  licensing wasn't handled well.
- When did multiple ownership mess up your plans?

This talk used to be called "software licensing".  You could mention
that to make it more interesting, we have adopted the current broader
name, and our emphasis is not just licensing, but why licensing is
needed.
