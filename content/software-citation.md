# Software citation

```{questions}
* How can software be cited?
* How can I make my software citeable?
```

```{objectives}
Learn about software citation.

## Software citation


```{discussion} Citation-1: Explain how you currently cite software
- Do you cite software that you use? How?
- If I wanted to cite your code/scripts, what would I need to do?
```

- Get a [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).
- Open source license can't demand citation, but it is required by science ethics anyway.
- Make it as easy as possible! Clearly say what you want cited.
- Make it easy for scripts and tools, use the [Citation file format](https://citation-file-format.github.io):
```
cff-version: 1.0.3
message: If you use numgrid, please cite it as below.
authors:
  - family-names: Bast
    given-names: Radovan
title: numgrid
version: 1.0.2
doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1470277
date-released: 2018-10-24
```
### Publishing papers about software

- [The Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/about)
- [In which journals should I publish my software?](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software)
- <https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles>

## Where to place your code

- <https://github.com>: public or private repositories
- <https://gitlab.com>: public or private repositories
- <https://source.coderefinery.org>: public or private repositories

**Making code public is not enough! Why? Get a DOI in addition.**

## Final discussion

```{discussion} Citation-2: Consider the overall picture of your code
- Who owns the code that you write?
- Does your code/script have a license?
- Can you take your own code with you after the PhD?
- Are you using open source software in your work?
- What are your thoughts about sharing software with your colleagues or competitors?
```

```{keypoints}
- License your code **very early** in the project:
  ideally develop publicly accessible open source code **from day one**.
- Make it easy to cite your code ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org))
- Do not forget to cite code you use.
```
