## Sharing research data

The Open Science movement encourages researchers
to share research output beyond the contents of a
published academic article (and possibly supplementary information).

```

Arguments in favor [(from Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science):
- Open access publication of research reports and data allows for rigorous peer-review
- Science is publicly funded so all results of the research should be publicly available
- Open Science will make science more reproducible and transparent
- Open Science has more impact
- Open Science will help answer uniquely complex questions

Arguments against [(from Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science):
- Too much unsorted information overwhelms scientists
- Potential misuse
- The public will misunderstand science data
- Increasing the scale of science will make verification of any discovery more difficult
- Low-quality science

## FAIR principles

"FAIR" is the current buzzword for data management. You may be asked
about it in, for example, making data management plans for grants:

- **F**indable
  - Will anyone else know that your data exists?
  - Solutions: put it in a standard repository, or at least a
    description of the data. Get a digital object identifier (DOI).
- **A**ccessible
  - Once someone knows that the data exists, can they get it?
  - Usually solved by being in a repository, but for non-open data,
    may require more procedures.
- **I**nteroperable
  - Is your data in a format that can be used by others, like csv
    instead of PDF?
  - Or better than csv. Example: [5-star open data](https://5stardata.info/en/)
- **R**eusable
  - Is there a license allowing others to re-use?

Even though this is usually referred to as "open data", it means
considering and making good decisions, even if non-open.

FAIR principles are usually discussed in the context of data,
but they apply also for research software.

Note that FAIR principles do not require data/software to be open.

```{discussion} Discuss open science
- Do you share any other research outputs besides published articles and possibly source code?
- Discuss pros and cons of sharing research data.

## Exercise - Connecting repositories to Zenodo

```{exercise} Sharing-1: Get a DOI from Zenodo
Digital object identifiers (DOI) are the backbone of the academic
reference and metrics system. In this exercise we will see how to
make a GitHub repository citable by archiving it on the
[Zenodo](http://about.zenodo.org/) archiving service. Zenodo is a
general-purpose open access repository created by OpenAIRE and CERN.

1. Sign in to Zenodo using your GitHub account. For this exercise, use the
   sandbox service: [https://sandbox.zenodo.org/login/](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/login/). This is a test version of the real Zenodo platform.
2. Go to [https://sandbox.zenodo.org/account/settings/github/](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/account/settings/github/).
3. Find the repository you wish to publish,
   and flip the switch to ON.
4. Go to GitHub and create a **release**  by clicking the `Create a new release` on the
   right-hand side (a release is based on a Git tag, but is a higher-level GitHub feature).
   You will need to enter a tag name (e.g. v0.1) in the "Choose a tag" box.
5. Creating a new release will trigger Zenodo into archiving your repository,
   and a DOI badge will be displayed next to your repository after a minute
   or two. You can include it in your GitHub README file: click the
   DOI badge and copy the relevant format (Markdown, RST, HTML).
```

## Services for sharing and collaborating on research data

To find a research data repository for your data, you can search on the
[Registry of Research Data Repositories (re3data)](https://www.re3data.org/)
platform and filter by country, content type, discipline, etc.

**International:**

- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): A general-purpose open access repository
  created by OpenAIRE and CERN. Integration with GitHub, allows
  researchers to upload files up to 50 GB.
- [Figshare](https://figshare.com/): Online digital repository where researchers
  can preserve and share their research outputs (figures, datasets, images and videos).
  Users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable,
  shareable and discoverable manner.
- [EUDAT](https://eudat.eu): European platform for researchers and practitioners from any research discipline to preserve, find, access, and process data in a trusted environment.
- [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/): A general-purpose home for a wide diversity of datatypes,
  governed by a nonprofit membership organization.
  A curated resource that makes the data underlying scientific publications discoverable,
  freely reusable, and citable.
- [The Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/): Gives free accounts for collaboration
  around files and other research artifacts. Each account can have up to 5 GB of files
  without any problem, and it remains private until you make it public.

**Sweden:**

- [ICOS for climate data](http://www.icos-sweden.se/)
- [Bolin center climate / geodata](https://bolin.su.se/data/)
- [NBIS for life science, sequence –omics data](https://nbis.se/infrastructure)

**Norway:**

- [NIRD archive is widely used by some communities](https://archive.norstore.no/)
- [NSD - Norwegian Center for Research Data, for any kind of data](https://nsd.no/nsd/english/index.html)
- [Dataverse.no - Dataverse network, based at University of Tromsø but open for other institutions](https://dataverse.no/)

**Denmark:**
